# Golang Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Golang based examples of many
popular data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.
