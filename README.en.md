## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and
modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and
the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures that have been implemented.

- [set](collections/set/set.go)
- [stack](collections/stack/stack.go)
- [queue](collections/queue/queue.go)
- [hashmap](collections/hashmap/hashmap.go)
- [linked list](collections/linkedlist/linkedlist.go)
- [graph](collections/graph/graph.go)
- [binary search tree](collections/tree/bin_search_tree.go)
- [trie](collections/tree/trie.go)

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely
define a sequence of operations.

Algorithms that have been implemented.

- [interpolation search](algorithms/search/interpolation_search.go)
- [sort](algorithms/sort/basic.go)
